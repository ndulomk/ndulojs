# NduloJS

> A TypeScript backend framework that enforces good architecture from day one.

Built for developers who are learning — NduloJS gives you Clean Architecture, functional patterns, and dependency injection **by default**, not as an afterthought.

## Philosophy

- **Functional first** — everything is a function. OOP is possible, not required.
- **Result pattern** — no more uncontrolled try/catch. Errors are values.
- **Structured by design** — the CLI generates the right structure so you can't do it wrong.
- **Learn by doing** — use the framework and absorb the architecture.

## Stack

- Runtime: [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- HTTP: [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com) (abstracted)
- Validation: [Zod](https://zod.dev)
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
